Hey, it's me, @CPlusPatch, welcome to my GitHub.
I haven't done much for the world so all of my stuff is private, but if I actually decide to get a move on and actually make something useful well then it'll show up here.
I do coding as a hobby, like dogs and play Minecraft (would be nice to make a mod for that somedays).
Honestly why are you even here? I probably posted cringe online and now you're searching for bad code to embarrass me.
